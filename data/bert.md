# BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding

We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al. 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).

## Pre-training Objectives

BERT uses two unsupervised pre-training tasks. The first is Masked Language Modeling (MLM): 15% of input tokens are randomly masked, and the model must predict the original token from context. This allows bidirectional training, unlike left-to-right models like GPT which can only condition on previous tokens. Of the selected 15% of tokens, 80% are replaced with [MASK], 10% with a random token, and 10% are left unchanged. The second task is Next Sentence Prediction (NSP): the model receives pairs of sentences and must predict whether the second sentence follows the first in the original document, helping the model understand inter-sentence relationships for tasks like question answering and natural language inference.

## Architecture and Models

BERT's architecture uses only the encoder portion of the Transformer. Two model sizes were released: BERT-BASE with 12 layers, 768 hidden dimensions, 12 attention heads, and 110 million parameters; and BERT-LARGE with 24 layers, 1024 hidden dimensions, 16 attention heads, and 340 million parameters. The models were pre-trained on the BooksCorpus (800 million words) and English Wikipedia (2,500 million words). Pre-training BERT-LARGE was performed on 16 TPU chips for 4 days. The input representation uses WordPiece tokenization with a 30,000 token vocabulary and includes special tokens: [CLS] at the start for classification tasks and [SEP] to separate sentence pairs.

## Fine-tuning and Results

Fine-tuning BERT for a specific task is straightforward: add a task-specific output layer and train all parameters end-to-end for a few epochs. This simple approach achieved state-of-the-art results across eleven NLP benchmarks at the time of publication. On the GLUE benchmark, BERT-LARGE scored 80.5%, a 7.7 point improvement over the previous best. On SQuAD v1.1, it achieved 93.2 F1, surpassing human performance (91.2 F1). BERT demonstrated that deep bidirectional pre-training is crucial: ablation studies showed that removing bidirectionality (making it left-to-right like GPT) significantly degraded performance across all tasks, validating the core architectural choice.
