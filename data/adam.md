# Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization

We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.

## Algorithm

Adam computes individual adaptive learning rates for different parameters from estimates of first and second moments of the gradients. Specifically, the algorithm maintains exponential moving averages of the gradient (first moment, m_t) and the squared gradient (second moment, v_t), with decay rates β1 and β2 respectively. These moving averages are estimates of the mean and the uncentered variance of the gradients. The default values proposed in the paper are β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.999, and ε = 10^-8. Because m_t and v_t are initialized as zero vectors, they are biased towards zero during the initial timesteps. Adam counteracts this with bias-corrected estimates: m̂_t = m_t / (1 − β1^t) and v̂_t = v_t / (1 − β2^t). The parameter update rule is then θ_t = θ_{t−1} − α · m̂_t / (√v̂_t + ε), where α is the step size (learning rate).

## Relation to Other Optimizers

Adam combines the advantages of two popular optimization methods: AdaGrad, which works well with sparse gradients, and RMSProp, which works well in non-stationary settings. AdaGrad adapts the learning rate per parameter by accumulating all past squared gradients, but its effective learning rate shrinks monotonically, making it unsuitable for non-convex problems. RMSProp addresses this by using an exponential moving average of squared gradients instead. Adam extends RMSProp by also incorporating momentum through the first moment estimate. The paper also introduces AdaMax, a variant that replaces the L2 norm of the gradient used in Adam's second moment with the L-infinity norm, which can sometimes be more stable.

## Convergence and Impact

The authors provide a regret bound for Adam in the online convex optimization framework, showing convergence at a rate of O(1/√T), matching the best known bounds. Empirical experiments demonstrate strong performance on logistic regression, multi-layer neural networks, and convolutional neural networks. Adam has since become the default optimizer in most deep learning frameworks and is one of the most widely cited papers in machine learning, with applications spanning computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.
