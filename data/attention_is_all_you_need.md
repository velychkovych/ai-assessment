# Attention Is All You Need

The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.

## Architecture

The Transformer follows an encoder-decoder structure. The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers, with each layer having two sub-layers: a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers, but inserts a third sub-layer that performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. All sub-layers produce outputs of dimension d_model = 512. Residual connections are employed around each sub-layer, followed by layer normalization: the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)).

## Key Innovations

The paper introduces three fundamental innovations. First, scaled dot-product attention computes attention weights as softmax(QK^T / √d_k)V, where Q, K, V are query, key, and value matrices and the scaling factor √d_k prevents the dot products from growing too large. Second, multi-head attention runs h = 8 parallel attention heads, each operating on a projected dimension of d_k = d_v = d_model / h = 64, allowing the model to attend to information from different representation subspaces simultaneously. Third, since the architecture contains no recurrence or convolution, positional encodings using sine and cosine functions of different frequencies are added to the input embeddings to provide the model with information about token positions in the sequence.

## Training and Impact

The base Transformer model was trained for 12 hours on 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs, while the big model trained for 3.5 days on the same hardware. The training used the Adam optimizer with a custom learning rate schedule that includes a warmup phase. The Transformer's ability to process all positions in parallel, rather than sequentially like RNNs, dramatically reduces training time while improving quality. This architecture became the foundation for nearly all subsequent breakthroughs in NLP and AI, including BERT, GPT, and modern large language models.
